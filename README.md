## Hey, I'm Ben

- 🚆 I'm a Software Engineer for Capgemini Engineering, focused on writing safety critical software. Most of my work so far has been for trains
- 🤔 In my spare time I enjoy learning about lower level software. The boundary between hardware and software is where my interest lies
- 🧑🏻‍🍳 I also like to cook so feel free to check that out [here](https://www.instagram.com/bytes_by_ben/)
